                <p>The Fame Monster is a reissue of American singer Lady Gaga's debut studio album, The Fame (2008), and
                    was released on November 18, 2009, through Interscope Records. Initially planned solely as a deluxe
                    edition reissue of The Fame, Interscope later decided to release the eight new songs as a standalone
                    EP in some territories. The decision was also because Gaga believed the re-release was too expensive
                    and that the albums were conceptually different, describing them as yin and yang.</p>
